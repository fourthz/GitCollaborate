Author A is going to work on this scenario. He will come up with his own plot lines and then show it to Author B.

Author A is going to work on this scenario at the same time that Author B is working on scenario2. Notice that Author A now knows what Author B has done. The push has occurred.

At this point in the story I am overcome with joy. It has the emotional impact desired. Tears are streaming down my face.
